* Add error messages to the responses.
* Tests for the new and old API versions (serialisation).
* Tests for the validate_only functionality.
* Update AdminClient docs for the policy violation.
* Add policy calls to deletetopics, deleterecords and addpartitions.
* Extend add tests for the new policy applications.
* Decide whether its OK for the old version of the response to return a new error code (POLICY_VIOLATION)
  If not, we could map it to an existing error code UNKNOWN_SERVER_ERROR for the old version only.
