#
# The layout of each log message can be modified to include the Mapped Diagnostic Context parameters used by Connect,
# which will include connector-specific and task-specific information on each log message and making it easier to identify
# which log messages belong to which connector and tasks.
#
# The following parameters specified in the layout will be replaced with the corresponding values in every log message:
#
# Use %X{connector.name} for the name of the connector
# Use %X{connector.scope} for the scope within a connector (e.g., "worker", "task", or "offsets")
# Use %X{connector.task} for the 1-based number of the task, or blank if not within a connector task
#
