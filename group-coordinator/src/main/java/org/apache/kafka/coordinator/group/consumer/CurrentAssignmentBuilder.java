/**
 * The CurrentAssignmentBuilder class encapsulates the reconciliation engine of the
 * consumer group protocol. Given the current state of a member and a desired or target
 * assignment state, the state machine takes the necessary steps to converge them.
 *
 * State Machine:
 * - STABLE:
 *   The member is fully reconciled to the desired target assignment.
 *
 *   Valid Transitions:
 *   - STABLE -> STABLE
 *     When a new target assignment is installed but the assignment of the member
 *     has not changed, the member transitions to the next epoch and remains in
 *     the STABLE state.
 *
 *   - STABLE -> UNACKNOWLEDGED_ASSIGNMENT
 *     When a new target assignment is installed and a new assignment is computed
 *     for the member, he transitions to the UNACKNOWLEDGED_ASSIGNMENT state.
 *
 *     If the next assignment contains partitions to be revoked, the member stays
 *     in his current epoch. Otherwise, he transitions to the target epoch.
 *
 *   - STABLE -> UNRELEASED_PARTITIONS
 *     When a new target assignment is installed and all the newly assigned partitions
 *     are not available yet, he transitions to the UNRELEASED_PARTITIONS state
 *     and waits until at least one of them is available.
 *
 * - UNACKNOWLEDGED_ASSIGNMENT:
 *   The member has received a new assignment from the group coordinator but
 *   he has not acknowledged it yet. The member is removed from the group if
 *   he does not acknowledge it within the rebalance timeout.
 *
 *   Valid Transitions:
 *   - UNACKNOWLEDGED_ASSIGNMENT -> STABLE
 *     When the assignment is acknowledged, the member transitions to the STABLE
 *     state if it is fully reconciled.
 *
 *   - UNACKNOWLEDGED_ASSIGNMENT -> UNACKNOWLEDGED_ASSIGNMENT
 *     When the assignment is acknowledged, the member remains in the
 *     UNACKNOWLEDGED_ASSIGNMENT state if a new assignment is computed.
 *
 *     If the next assignment contains partitions to be revoked, the member stays
 *     in his current epoch. Otherwise, he transitions to the target epoch.
 *
 *   - UNACKNOWLEDGED_ASSIGNMENT -> UNRELEASED_PARTITIONS
 *     When the assignment is acknowledged, the member transitions to the
 *     UNRELEASED_PARTITIONS if newly assigned partitions are not available yet.
 *
 * - UNRELEASED_PARTITIONS:
 *   The member's reconciliation cannot progress because newly assigned partitions
 *   are still owned by other members in the group. They are not released yet.
 *
 *   Valid Transitions:
 *   - UNRELEASED_PARTITIONS -> STABLE
 *     The member may transition to the STABLE state if the partitions that he
 *     was awaiting on are no longer in the desired target assignment.
 *
 *   - UNRELEASED_PARTITIONS -> UNACKNOWLEDGED_ASSIGNMENT
 *     When at least one partition become available, a new assignment is computed
 *     for the member and he transitions to the UNACKNOWLEDGED_ASSIGNMENT state.
 *
 *     If the next assignment contains partitions to be revoked, the member stays
 *     in his current epoch. Otherwise, he transitions to the target epoch.
 *
 *   - UNRELEASED_PARTITIONS -> UNRELEASED_PARTITIONS
 *     The member remains in the UNRELEASED_PARTITIONS state until at least one
 *     partition become available.
