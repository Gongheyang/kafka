 * General helper functions!

 * If you are making a new helper function and want to add it to this class please ensure the following:
 * 1. It has documentation
 * 2. It is the most general possible utility, not just the thing you needed in one particular place
 * 3. You have tests for it if it is nontrivial in any way
